/* pan, pan ready, pan fried, pandemic, Path Aware Networking, peter pan,

Package pan provides a policy-based path aware network layer for building
applications supporting SCION natively.

Differences to previous approach "pkg/appnet" and scionproto/scion's snet:
- higher level: pan automatically takes care of timely path refresh, fail-over etc.
  The interface to pan talks about path *policies* and path selector
  mechanisms, not individual paths.
- self-contained: does not require importing random internal scion libraries
- address does not contain path. This may seems like a technicality, but having
  the path in the address is really quite awkward when passing addresses through
  layers that do not know about this. For example, in snet/squic, the quic server
  just keeps replying using the path on which the first packet arrived. This
  will seem to work initially, but can't work once this path expires -- working
  around this requires tricksery.

Goals:
- make it easy to write *correct* applications using SCION
- support common use cases

Non-goals:
- expose all low level details or allow to tweak every parameter...


TODO add name resolution, copy-paste from appnet
TODO limit resources used by listener; max sessions & cleanup after timeout, also for stats
TODO explicit cleanup of listener conn paths when quic session ends
TODO hijacking by src address spoofing and bad path.
		 idea: stick to _first_ path initially, asynchronously fetch return paths
		 and allow matching paths (policy!)

Features / Usecases

- select path based on filter and preference
  - filter based on ISD / ASes traversed
  - filter based on attributes (length, latency, ...)
  - order by attributes
  - disjoint from previous paths
- interactive choice
  - optionally with fallback in case path dies
    -> in this mode, manual input can be considered a preference order
- keep paths fresh
  - reevaluate selection or just update selected path?
    -> answer: reevaluate selection; partial order, compare from current
               only update selected should be achievable too (analogous to interactive choice)
- remove dead paths and fail over
  - by SCMP
  - by indication of application
  - by expiration in less than ~10s

- race opening
- path negotiation
- server side path policy?
- active probing
  -> in data stream? out of stream? or only on the side, control?
- active path control from outside (API/user interaction -- see below)

- couple multiple selectors to use different/disjoint paths to maximize bandwidth
  -> correctly handle failover etc.
  -> only need disjointness on bottleneck links (yay for having per link information in metadata!)
  -> this is interesting e.g. for "grid-FTP" style application where multiple QUIC sessions run over

- http/quic with path control
  - application can give policy
  - application can change policy
  - application can somehow determine currently used path (ok if this is not part of "stable" API)
  - application can change currently used path
  - in a UI like some browser extension, a user may e.g.
    - see the currently used path, see the dial race and path failover
    - explicitly forbid/unforbid a specific path, switch away if it's the current path
    - force use of a specific path
